# Nexus Webhook Collection Example - NOW IN GOLANG!

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/sonatype/nexus-developers](https://badges.gitter.im/sonatype/nexus-developers.svg)](https://gitter.im/sonatype/nexus-developers?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

# What is this?

A go library for colecting Webhooks from a Sonatype Nexus IQ server. It is useful to be able to collect the outcoming Webhooks and then extend them to forward them to other services like ELK, Splunk or Slack (examples to come!)

## The Fine Print

It is worth noting that this is **NOT SUPPORTED** by Sonatype, and is a contribution of ours
to the open source community (read: you!)

Remember:

* Use this contribution at the risk tolerance that you have
* Do NOT file Sonatype support tickets for support in regard to this example
* DO file issues here on GitHub, so that the community can pitch in

Phew, that was easier than I thought. Last but not least of all:

Have fun creating and using this plugin and the Nexus platform, we are glad to have you here!
